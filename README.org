#+title: discord-emoji

Let's bring Discord's emoji insertion into Emacs!
As someone accustomed to Discord's emoji shortcodes, I've become tired with Emacs's existing emoji insertion methods, most of which use the verbose Emoji names defined in the Unicode spec, like ~face with tears of joy~ instead of Discord's much simpler ~:joy:~ (ðŸ˜‚).
Also, certain emojis have completely different names under Discord, like ~:sob:~ compared to ~loudly crying face~ (ðŸ˜­); overall, having to relearn the emoji names to insert them in Emacs is not ideal.

* Installation
This package is not yet on MELPA, so using ~straight.el~ you will need something like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! discord-emoji
  :recipe (:host github :repo "srithon/discord-emoji.el"))
#+end_src
* Configuration
To use the package, simply bind a key combination to ~discord-emoji-insert~.
I'm using Doom Emacs (with Evil Mode), so my configuration looks like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! discord-emoji
  :defer
  :config
  (map! :desc "Opens emoji insertion menu."
        :i "M-e"
        #'discord-emoji-insert))
#+end_src

Also, you can configure the ~discord-emoji-category~ face to change how the category annotation is displayed.
* Implementation Details
After searching the internet, I found [[https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/5349][this issue]] on the [[https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs][discord-api-docs]] repository, where someone linked [[https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/5349][this JSON]] containing Discord's emoji mappings.
To be safe, in case the URL goes dead, I've included the JSON source in this repository.
* Future Plans
Down the line, it would be interesting to extend this project to a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion-in-Buffers.html][completion-at-point]] source or [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company]] backend.
These would arguably interrope better with the standard Emacs experience, /but/ I would personally continue to use the current input method.
